              <b><u>Buoy Data</b></u><br>The data for each buoy was pulled from the National Data Buoy Center during the time period of January 2005 through December 2019.
              We compiled data during this timeframe for ten specific buoys in the Gulf of Mexico region <b>(Buoy locations pictured above)</b>.
              Buoy data is collected via satellite and sent to the National Data Buoy Center which collects, analyzes and sends out the data. We had to pull data for each buoy separately, which then
              made it necessary to do a lot of data cleanup and joining in order to get all the data in the same format and same document <b>(Sample buoy data pictured above)</b>.. Once this was put together, we were able to determine dates for the data from each
              buoy when there was a storm versus no storm using the hurricane and tropical storm data explained below.
            </p>

            <p> <b><u>Hurricane and Tropical Storm Data</b></u><br>
              The data we found for hurricanes and tropical storms was pulled from the Hurricane Research Division - Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory. We were able to pull hurricane and tropical storm data
              from the Atlantic for the last 15 years from this site. This data provided storm category, some conditions, affected states, date of the storm, and the name of the storm. We had to combine this data with our buoy data in order to match up the buoy data with
              each day there was a storm and also to know which days did not have storms.

                    <li>In 2005, a couple buoy were knocked out of commission during hurricane Katrina. Because of this, there is no data for a those couple of buoys from late August to mid October in 2005.</li>
                    <li>There were hurricanes dating back as early as 1851 we could have utilized, but the buoy data did not go back that far.</li>
                    <li>We used a static number for each hurricane category, which means we did not encompass the category changes of the hurricane throughout its lifecycle.</li>
                    <li>Not all buoy we used may have been close to or in the path of each hurricane. The data from these buoys would most likely be less useful and cause our model to learn inaccurately how to predict storms.</li>
                    <li>We understand there are other data sources out there that help predict hurricanes and tropical storms, however we wanted to focus solely on the buoys data for this project.</li>
